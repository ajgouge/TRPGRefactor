# TRPGRefactor
A cleanup of an earlier project of mine, in an attempt to make it more workable.

The older version of this project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ajgouge/Final-Project">ajgouge/Final-Project</a>. It was full of bad practices and bugs, so I'm attempting to clean it up and make it better.

This includes the following:
<ul>
  <li>Making an asset loader and manager</li>
  <li>Adding animated sprites</li>
  <li>Making the graphics and UI much better</li>
  <li>Adding adjustable graphics settings</li>
  <li>Adding music and sounds</li>
  <li>Making gameplay more interesting</li>
  <li>Generally refactoring the project for readability and good practices</li>
</ul>

This is written in C++ (I think 11? That could change) using SDL2. It's primarily being developed for Windows, though support for other OSes may be added later in the project.
